(** {1 Unification Constraint} *)

(** A constraint is a pair of (scoped) terms that cannot be unified
    immediately (because they belong to some theory, for example).

    We keep them in a separate constraint that will become a negative
    literal [t â‰  u], on which the theory can then act.

(** A constraint delayed because unification for this pair of terms is
      not syntactic *)
